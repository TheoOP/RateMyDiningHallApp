First step open two terminals in vscode
In the first terminal cd into the client folder 
cd client
Use the second terminal and cd into the server folder
cd server

for both terminals use npm to install the necessary packages 
type npm install in both terminals

in client terminal type 
npm install react-icons --save

once packages are installed
in both terminals type
npm run dev
this will run the front end to a port in the 5000s
and the server should display hello world or something in port 5200
